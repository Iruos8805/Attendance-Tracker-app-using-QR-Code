######Attendance tracker using QR code mechanism###### 
The objective is to develop an attendance tracking app, serving as a precursor to a broader concept. In each classroom, QR code scanners enable students to easily log their attendance by scanning their unique QR codes. Teachers can create class schedules with specified time slots for different subjects. During these sessions, students use the designated scanners to scan their QR codes, automatically marking their attendance.

After a successful scan, the attendance information is instantly recorded. Teachers can access a detailed attendance list, viewable and downloadable for administrative purposes. Additionally, students are also able to view their attendance report regarding their attendance, ensuring they stay informed about their class participation.
